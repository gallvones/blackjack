ARCADE BLACKJACK - A GAME DEVELOPER WITH NEST.JS AND NEXT.JS USING TYPESCRIPT 👨🏻‍💻
Summary of Rules:
No dealer — it’s just you versus the deck.
start → creates a new round (shuffled deck, 1 initial card).
hit → draw 1 card; if total > 21 ⇒ bust (0 points).
stand → stop, compute points, and add to the balance.
Scoring:
> 21: 0
= 21: 100
1–20: floor((total / 21) * 100)
Deck: 1 standard 52-card deck; J/Q/K = 10, Ace = 1 or 11 (whichever doesn’t bust).

Getting Started:
Just clone the project and start the frontend and backend separately:
in the frontend folder’s terminal, run ->  npm run dev 
in the backend folder’s terminal, run -> npm run start
